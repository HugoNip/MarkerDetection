# Marker Detection

## Introduction
This project provides several methods to detect the targets on a moving object (e.g., shaking pipe).
The type of targets includes natural and manual marker. 
The natural marker indicates some areas with rich features and can be detected by feature-matching related methods, 
while the manual markers includes circle, squares captured from checker board, and multiple lines 
and can be detected by corner detectors, line detectors, and optical flow related methods.

## Marker Datasets
The marker videos are generated by my [Pipe Vibration Animation](https://github.com/HugoNip/PipeVibrationAnimation1.0) project.
